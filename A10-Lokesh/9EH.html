<h2><font color="yellow">Target Scoping is defined as an empirical process for gathering target assessment requirements and characterizing each of its parameters to generate a test plan, limitations, business objectives, and time schedule. This process plays an important role in defining clear objectives towards any kind of security assessment. By determining these key objectives one can easily draw a practical roadmap of what will be tested, how it should be tested, what resources will be allocated, what limitations will be applied, what business objectives will be achieved, and how the test project will be planned and scheduled. Thus, we have combined all of these elements and presented them in a formalized scope process to achieve the required goal.<br>
Following are the key concepts of Target Scoping:

Gathering client requirements deals with accumulating information about the target environment through verbal or written communication.
Preparing test plan depends on different sets of variables. These may include shaping the actual requirements into structured testing process, legal agreements, cost analysis, and resource allocation.
Profiling test boundaries determines the limitations associated with the penetration testing assignment. These can be a limitation of technology, knowledge, or a formal restriction on the clientâ€™s IT environment.
Defining business objectives is a process of aligning business view with technical objectives of the penetration testing program.
Project management and scheduling directs every other step of the penetration testing process with a proper timeline for test execution. This can be achieved by using a number of advanced project management tools.
