<h2><font color="ff0033">Metasploit is the favorite exploitation framework among the penetration testers . Metasploit can be used in a variety of penetration testing scenarios . One of the easiest way of spreading the exploit code through an exe file . But the major drawback in this technique is that the Antiviruses might catch the EXE as malicious as the AV engines more cautious for the PE files . So are the Targets now .

<br>The Good News : Metasploit comes with Exploits for the Word and Excel Too . This means that you can create malicious word / excel documents that can give a reverse shell to you the same way the native exe (PE) files do . This is great strategy to use in your penetration tests to see what defence we are holding against these attacks .
