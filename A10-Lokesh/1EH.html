<h2><font color="ff0033">The goal of this tutorial is to configure and execute a Credential Harvester attack with SET.

A typical SET attack needs a server with a public address, which is difficult to simulate in a lab. Instead, SET will be used to launch the attack on the local network and the you can manually visit the malicious site for the sake of this tutorial . In a live attack, the SET server would be accessible via the Internet and the malicious link would be sent to the target using web mail, an ISP email account, or a dedicated phishing email account. Start the lab by launching SET.<br>
