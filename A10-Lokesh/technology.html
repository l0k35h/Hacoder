<br>Technology has always been a present force acting in the world. It started out as simple things like tools that were created by the most primitive humans and evolved into other tools that made life easier for the people who created them. In the mid 20th century, the technological advances began to boom. People realized that computers were the way of the future and would make life easier for anyone who used them. Scientists, engineers and computer enthusiasts began to look for new ways to make computers do tasks that would normally be done by humans. This technology eventually led to the introduction of the Internet and wireless communication. Cell phones, laptops and tablets are a result of constant technological evolution. They are the ultimate in communication and allow people to stay connected with friends and loved ones at all times; something that would be impossible without technology.<br>
