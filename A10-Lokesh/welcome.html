<h2><font color="ff0033"> The term ethical hacking may sound like an oxymoron. How can hacking be ethical?  Well, it means hacking or penetrating a system for legal purposes.Plainly put,ethical hacking is hacking for Samaritan purposes. It is the process of penetrating the secure network to detect weaknesses in the system that can be susceptible to loopholes and dangers and fixing the system so as no one else can take advantage of it.  While the normal hackers discover the vulnerability and use it to take advantage of the users of the certain product without anybody knowing it – the ethical hacker discovers it and patches the problem before anybody else discovers it.<br>
You need to be an expert in computer and networking to be an ethical hacker. You would be required to use the same testing tools as your counterparts but would be required to report and solve problems instead of taking advantage of the loopholes. Ethical hacker has earned the sobriquet of a white hat, a term that owes its genesis to the old English movies where the Samaritan wore a white hat. Today, organizations hinge on security systems and this has created the need for ethical hackers, who in order to catch a miscreant think like a miscreant.<br>
Getting in:<br>
What you need to do to get started on the road to becoming an ethical hacker depends on where you are in the IT field.You can takeup a certification in Ethical Hackingafter Graduation /Postgraduation in Computer Science and Information Technology.For a hacker, networking know-how is vital. Discover and play with Unix/Linux commands and distributions. Make sure you also learn some programming–maybe C, LISP, Perl, or Java. And spend some time with databases such as SQL.Besides, you need to have a Systems thinking approach, analytical reasoning, out of the box thinking, and an attitude of going to the depth of every problem.<br>

Certifications:<br>
Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH):<br>
It involves earning the certification from the EC-Council (http://www.eccouncil.org/) after two years of security-related IT experience. The certification will help you understand security from the mindset of a hacker. You’ll learn the common types of exploits, vulnerabilities, and countermeasures.<br>
The course of study covers creating Trojan horses, backdoors, viruses, and worms. It also covers denial of service (DoS) attacks, SQL injection, buffer overflow, session hijacking, and system hacking. You’ll discover how to hijack Web servers and Web applications. You’ll also find out how to scan and sniff networks, crack wireless encryption, and evade IDSs, firewalls, and honeypots.<br>
Through approved EC-Council training partners, you can take a live, five-day onsite or online training course to prepare for the CEH cert. You can generally take live online classes over five consecutive days; onsite courses typically offer the content spread over a couple weeks for locals. In addition, you can take self-paced courses and work with self-study materials with or without the training courses. The EC-Council also offers iLabs, a subscription based-service that allows you to log on to virtualized remote machines to perform exercises.<br>
