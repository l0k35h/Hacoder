 Facebook Messenger allows you to chat with Strangers without being Friends, Does this sounds strange? Off course not because Facebook Messenger allows you to chat with strangers.
<br>
The most common problem that People usually face on social media websites like Facebook is receiving messages or friend requests from strangers which you donâ€™t know. This functionality was already there in Facebook Messenger that you can chat with strangers, but now Facebook has added a new feature which will help Facebook Messenger users to know details about Stranger that with whom you are chatting. So you can still chat with people who are not on your friend list but you can explore details about them by just knowing their names. Hence no more any stranger will be bothering you on Messenger.
