<h2><font color="ff0033">Penetration testing of Credential Data over Encrypted Channel – As part of user’s authentication penetration testing, it is must to pen test how credential data (sensitive data) is transported over an encrypted channel to avoid being intercepted by some malicious hackers via Men-in-Middle type attacks. As we all know, just using https connection doesn’t mean that data transmission is completely safe. The security also depends of other parameters like encryption algorithm used and robustness of keys (public & private keys) used within.

If we are concerned about credential data penetration testing or application penetration testing, then very first thing that comes in mind of every penetration tester is Login page of a website or web application. The very first thing a penetration tester has to ensure is, how data is being transmitted over network i.e. whether its using encrypted (https) or unencrypted (http) channel. Now lets consider the best case scenario, its using encrypted channel i.e. https connection. But before extending you must learn the basic difference between Http and Https connections. Http protocol transfers data in a non-secure way, basically in clear text format while Https encrypts data during transmission; hence encrypted data is transferred over channel.<br>
