<br>Users having old processors i.e. before Intel’s I series i.e. I3, I5 or I7 were not facing such issues because Virtualization was enabled by default but as the processors were upgraded major ROM manufacturers like Intel, Asus etc have made it an optional feature in their OS which is disabled by default. So whenever you try to install any virtual OS on your existing operating system you will get below error message:
“This kernel requires an x86-64 CPU, but only detected an i686 CPU“
This error message comes when Virtualization is not enabled on your Boot Menu System Configuration.

Now you all must be confused what the hell is this Virtualization? Virtualization is a term that refers to the various techniques, methods or approaches of creating a virtual (rather than actual) version of something, such as a virtual hardware platform, operating system (OS), storage device, or network resources.
